                The Challenge
              </h2>
              <p className='text-lg text-gray-600'>
                In todayâ€™s fast-moving world, staying connected isnâ€™t a luxury â€”
                itâ€™s a necessity. But for many people, especially in busy
                cities, phone batteries donâ€™t last as long as the day demands.
                Imagine rushing to a meeting, trying to confirm a ride, or
                needing to make a quick transfer â€” and your phone dies. No
                socket in sight, no power bank on hand. This is a daily
                frustration for countless Nigerians who rely on their phones for
                everything from communication to digital payments. The lack of
                convenient, on-the-go charging options doesnâ€™t just cause
                inconvenience â€” it disrupts work, plans, and access to essential
                services.

                The Solution
              </h2>
              <p className='text-lg text-gray-600'>
                Thatâ€™s where CrowdCarry comes in. Weâ€™ve built a network of
                self-charging power bank stations across major cities, so anyone
                can rent a power bank on the go â€” no more getting stuck with a
                dead phone when it matters most. Instead of buying an expensive
                power bank or searching for a socket, users simply grab, charge,
                and return. To make the experience even smoother, we designed a
                user-friendly website that lets people explore our services,
                locate nearby stations, and rent a power bank in just a few
                clicks. Itâ€™s affordable, convenient, and built for the pace of
                real life. âš¡ðŸ“±

            Designing for Convenience: The UX Process Behind CrowdCarry
          </h1>

          <p className='mb-6'>
            After analyzing the user interviews, I realized that building a
            solar website wasnâ€™t just about showcasing products â€” it had to
            solve four key challenges: making solar information easy to
            understand, building user trust, simplifying cost estimation, and
            guiding users based on their needs (homeowners, businesses, or
            facility managers).
          </p>

          <p className='mb-6'>
            When I joined the CrowdCarry project, I knew this wasnâ€™t just
            another tech platform â€” it was a real-world solution to a real-world
            problem: helping people stay powered, connected, and stress-free
            while on the move. So, my goal was simple: design a website that
            makes renting a power bank feel as quick and easy as unlocking your
            phone.
          </p>

          <p className='mb-6'>Hereâ€™s how I approached it:</p>

          <h2 className='text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2'>
            1. Understanding the Users
          </h2>
          <p className='mb-4'>
            I started with the people. I interviewed 10 everyday commuters, 4
            event attendees, and 3 small business owners who regularly deal with
            dead phone batteries while out and about. These conversations
            uncovered real frustrations:
          </p>
          <ul className='list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1'>
            <li>"I never carry a power bank â€” theyâ€™re bulky."</li>
            <li>"I donâ€™t know where to charge when Iâ€™m out."</li>
            <li>"It needs to be quick, or I wonâ€™t bother."</li>
          </ul>
          <p className='mb-6'>
            This helped me shape two core personas:
            <br />
            â€¢ The On-the-Go Commuter who needs speed and simplicity
            <br />â€¢ The Urban Explorer who values convenience and affordability
          </p>

          <h2 className='text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2'>
            2. Mapping the Journey
          </h2>
          <p className='mb-4'>
            Next, I mapped out the user journey from the moment someone realizes
            they need a charge â€” all the way to renting and returning a power
            bank.
          </p>
          <p className='mb-2'>I asked:</p>
          <ul className='list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1'>
            <li>Where are they when this need hits?</li>
            <li>How fast can they access the website?</li>
            <li>What decisions do they have to make before renting?</li>
          </ul>
          <p className='mb-6'>
            This led to designing a frictionless path:
            <br />
            Find a station â†’ Check availability â†’ Rent â†’ Charge â†’ Return
          </p>

          <h2 className='text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2'>
            3. Wire-framing with Purpose
          </h2>
          <p className='mb-4'>
            With clarity on the flow, I created low-fidelity wireframes focusing
            on three key goals:
          </p>
          <ul className='list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1'>
            <li>Speed: Users can find a rental station within seconds</li>
            <li>Trust: Clear pricing, usage terms, and safety info upfront</li>
            <li>
              Simplicity: One main CTA per screen, no clutter, no confusion
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className='mb-6'>
            Every screen served one function, so users wouldnâ€™t have to think
            twice.
          </p>

          <h2 className='text-xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-2'>
            4. Designing for Real-World Use
          </h2>
          <p className='mb-4'>
            I then moved to high-fidelity prototypes. The design used:
          </p>
          <ul className='list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-1'>
            <li>Bold visuals to catch attention in outdoor light</li>
            <li>Map integration to locate nearby stations</li>
            <li>Quick-scan QR instructions to make renting effortless</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Color choices were guided by urgency and energy â€” bright, vibrant
            tones that matched the electric, on-the-go vibe of the brand.
